# Translating from ORMS to SQLAlchemy Lab

## Learning Goals

- Use an external library to simplify tasks from earlier ORM lessons.
- Use SQLAlchemy to create, read, update and delete records in a SQL database.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Schema**: the blueprint of a database. Describes how data relates to other
  data in tables, columns, and relationships between them.
- **Persist**: save a schema in a database.
- **Engine**: a Python object that translates SQL to Python and vice-versa.
- **Session**: a Python object that uses an engine to allow us to
  programmatically interact with a database.
- **Transaction**: a strategy for executing database statements such that
  the group succeeds or fails as a unit.
- **Migration**: the process of moving data from one or more databases to one
  or more target databases..

## Instructions

This is a **test-driven lab**. Run `pipenv install` to create your virtual
environment and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment, then `cd`
into the `lib/` directory. Run
`pytest -x` to run your tests. Use these instructions and `pytest`'s error
messages to complete your work in the `lib/` folder.

The testing file for this lab will execute many of the same tests as _"Putting
it All Together: ORMs Lab"_ from the previous Canvas module. There are nine
tests in total: one for your data model in `lib/models.py` and eight for your
functions in `lib/dog.py`. In the previous lab, you had to write quite a bit of
code to get those tests passing- using SQLAlchemy, it should be much easier.

### Tips and Tricks

- The bodies of all functions in `dog.py` except `create_table()` and `save()`
  should be composed of a single line of code.
- Read through the `pytest` error messages to make sure the input and output
  for your functions match the tests.
- Remember which attributes are required when designing a SQLAlchemy data
  model: a `__tablename__`, a `primary_key`, and one or more `Column`s.

Once all of your tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to
submit.
